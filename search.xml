        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="The-Story-of-Sun"><a href="#The-Story-of-Sun" class="headerlink" title="The Story of Sun"></a>The Story of Sun</h1><p>Today, I am going to talk about the Sun and its magnificent beauty. Do you know what is the Sun？How can it shine for such long time？Now, you might be wondering about the origin and evolution of our Sun.<br>Our Sun is one of the star in our milky way galaxy, which was born about 4.5 billion years ago surrounded by a mote of dust near the tiny corner the galaxy. Our Sun is a category G- type main sequence star, often called G major star or yellow dwarf, which is in its middle age now. Up to now, it still shinning brilliantly on Earth sky. The Sun is composed of hydrogen, a small amount of helium and oxygen. It can shine brightly for billion years due to it provide the energy by a evolution of nuclear fusion!<br>Do you ever watch the glorious sunrise or sunset on our planet? Now, I am going to share the unusual process of the whole Sunrise.<br>On a Peaceful and delightful morning, I walked along the riverside and Planned to observe the sunrise. On the way, I saw the Moon in its last quarter in the western sky.<br>Surprisingly, I found its current phase to be an inverted form of the crescent shape.<br>At that moment, the Sun rose miraculously in the multi-hued eastern sky. Initially, the solar halo enveloping the sun was red. After a few minutes, the colors of the Sun changed from yellow to white. Fifteen minutes Later, the sun shone brightly in the sky. At that time, the glorious clouds had already disappeared, but the Moon still situated in the sky until 7:30am.<br>I seldom observed the Sun and the Moon together in the morning sky, so I was curious about their relative positions in the sky.<br>The next day, I arose early and enjoyed the impressive view of the sunrise again. There were some cumulus clouds that obscured the morning rays of sunlight. Soon after, a blazing sun broke through the cumulus clouds.<br>It was a glorious day that we couldn’t observe the whole sunrise. A few minutes before sunrise, I observed a Moon shaped like a sharp and slender scythe. Its Phase was in a form that was an inversion of that observed in July.<br>I was surprised by the crescent shape because it was my first time seeing it. After this, I determined to keep on observing sunrises and moonsets in the morning! Every night, I observe the stars and recall the old history of our universe.<br>Now, I am starting to share some incredible stories of the Sun.<br>It’s uniquely that the Sun stands for a male goddess, which protecting all of the things in the sky. Therefore, it’s a huge ball of hot, luminous gas. All 8 planets and associated moons orbit around it. We call this family the Solar System.<br>Without the Sun, a group of plants, creatures on Earth can not survive. Additionally, life depend on the power of our Sun. Please show our appreciation of our star as we depend on it. We get warm from the gentle sunlight, this is the wonderful time!<br>Thanks for the sun giving its giant and unlimited energy to lives on our planet！<br>Thank you very much! </p></br>                                <p><strong>Guo Linda</strong><br><em>6&#x2F;14&#x2F;2023</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Goddess-Moon"><a href="#Goddess-Moon" class="headerlink" title="Goddess Moon"></a>Goddess Moon</h1><p>Today, my speech is about the long story of goddess Moon, the only natural satellite of our blue planet Earth. I will share those unique and amazing features of our satellite in those paragraph clearly.<br>The Moon is the Earth’s only natural satellite, which was born about 4.5 billion years ago by a unexpected collision of the disordered celestial body in our early Solar System. This is the popular hypothesis of the origin of the Moon.<br>The Moon is one of the tidally lock satellite in our Solar System. That means we can only observe the one face of the Moon on Earth any time. The dark side of it the people on Earth have no chance to see it forever. Since the Moon was born, it already attract by the Earth’s violent gravity, so it’s rotation are tidally lock.<br>The Moon is actually 30 Earth- diameters away from us. The times when Earth’s shallow does fall on the Moon are called lunar eclipses and are discussed in eclipses of the Sun and the Moon. As Earth rotates from west to east , everything in the sky, including the Moon, appears to rise in the east and set in the west. However, although the time at which the sun rises and sets various little from day to day, the Moon rises and sets at noticeably different times. Since the Moon completes one revolution around about 13 to 15 degrees along its orbit of Earth each day. As a result, the Moon appears to rise about an hour later each night than the previous night. The Moon takes about 27.3 days to orbit Earth. A full lunar cycle, however, takes 29.5 days. This difference between the Moon’s orbiting time and a full cycle of phrases is because the Moon is orbiting Earth as Earth orbiting the Sun.<br>The Moon always shine at night, because it reflects the light from the Sun.In addition, it’s a lifeless ball, which has no its own light forever.<br>It’s uniquely that the Moon is named after Diana, a goddess of love and kind in Greek mythology. It stands for female.<br>The Moon’s gravity causes the tide of the seas on Earth. Therefore, it helps the residents that live near the sea to sailing freely. If they can follow the phases cycle of the Moon in a month, it will inspire them to realize which day the waves on the sea is the strongest or the weakest. So that they can sail flexibly and confidently！<br>Surprisingly, the Moon’s violent gravity is the crucial result of Earthquakes. Because the Earth and the Moon  are a double star system in our Solar system, so they always influence each other. That seems planet Earth and satellite Moon hold a strong relationship such as the devoted mother and her kind daughter. The two celestial bodies are helping each other over years.<br>Now, I will share my own observations and understandings of the phases of the Moon in a lunar month.<br>At new Moon, the Moon is lined up between the Earth and the Sun. We see the side of the Moon that is not being lit by the Sun. When the Moon is exactly lined up with the Sun, we experience an eclipse. As the Moon moves eastward away from the Sun in the sky, we see a bit more of the sunlit side of the Moon each night.<br>A few days after new moon, we see a thin crescent moon waxes, or appears to grow fatter each night. When half of the Moon’ disc is illuminated, we call it the first- quarter moon. This name comes from the fact that the Moon is now one - quarter of the way through the lunar month. From Earth, we are now looking at the sunlit side of the Moon from off to the side.<br>The Moon continues to wax. Once more than half of the disc is illuminated, it has a shape we called gibbous. The gibbous moon appears to grow fatter each night until we see the full sunlit face of the Moon. We call this phase the full Moon. It rises almost exactly as the Sun sets and sets just as the Sun rises the next day. The Moon has now completed one half of the lunar month. During the second half of the lunar month, the Moon grows thinner each night. We call this waning. Its shape is still gibbous at this point, but grows a little thinner each night. As it reaches the three- quarter point in lunar month, the Moon once again shows us one side of its disc illuminated and the other side in darkness. However, the side that we saw dark at the first quarter phase is now the lit side. As it completes its journey and approaches new moon again, the Moon is a waning crescent.<br>If you live on the Moon , you can see the Earth’s phases are opposite to the Moon’s phases when you live on Earth! The location of the Moon from the Earth keeps changing, so various phases appear on Earth’s sky.<br>The Moon , which shines by reflecting sunlight, looks bright in our naked eyes! There are many plains and countless craters on its back side, but unfortunately, we can never observe them on Earth.<br>Let me share some story of how the intelligent ancient people in China created the unique lunar calendar！The ancient people observed the Moon every day, so they realized that the Moon has its regular period when orbiting the Earth. Finally they made a big decision to follow this special revolution of the Moon and created the lunar calender in a year. They also use it to celebrated their lunar birthday.<br>In 1969, some famous American astronauts landed on the Moon from Earth！When those people  reached the Moon, they collect different rocks samples from the Moon to predict the age of it. They also took those samples back to Earth, so that learn a lot from that journey.<br>The Moon is a cold, dry and lifeless ball of rock with virtually no atmosphere or magnetic field. Therefore, it was stricken by a great many collide of asteroids.<br>Although the Moon is full of scars, it keeps helping the Earth support life over years!<br>Let’s show our appreciation of the kindly and devoted goddess！<br>Thank you！</p></br><p><strong>Guo Linda</strong><br><em>6&#x2F;4&#x2F;2023</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Introduce"><a href="#Introduce" class="headerlink" title="Introduce"></a>Introduce</h1><p>I’am Linda. My interest these years is astronomy, which is a part of natural science in western countries. Up to now, I starting observe the night sky every day forover four years. In addition, I snap many photos of celestial boodies by my camera. I record many amazing and colorful moments of celestial bodies in the universe. Science become my favourite subject now, I enjoy it very much!</p><img alt="Moon" src="/images/DSC_2242.JPG" title="photographed in 2023">]]></content>
