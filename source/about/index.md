I'am Linda. My interest these years is astronomy, which is a part of natural science in western countries. Up to now, I starting observe the night sky every day forover four years. In addition, I snap many photos of celestial boodies by my camera. I record many amazing and colorful moments of celestial bodies in the universe. Science become my favourite subject now, I enjoy it very much!
