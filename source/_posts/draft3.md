# The Story of Sun

Today, I am going to talk about the Sun and its magnificent beauty. Do you know what is the Sun？How can it shine for such long time？Now, you might be wondering about the origin and evolution of our Sun. 
Our Sun is one of the star in our milky way galaxy, which was born about 4.5 billion years ago surrounded by a mote of dust near the tiny corner the galaxy. Our Sun is a category G- type main sequence star, often called G major star or yellow dwarf, which is in its middle age now. Up to now, it still shinning brilliantly on Earth sky. The Sun is composed of hydrogen, a small amount of helium and oxygen. It can shine brightly for billion years due to it provide the energy by a evolution of nuclear fusion! 
Do you ever watch the glorious sunrise or sunset on our planet? Now, I am going to share the unusual process of the whole Sunrise. 
On a Peaceful and delightful morning, I walked along the riverside and Planned to observe the sunrise. On the way, I saw the Moon in its last quarter in the western sky. 
Surprisingly, I found its current phase to be an inverted form of the crescent shape. 
At that moment, the Sun rose miraculously in the multi-hued eastern sky. Initially, the solar halo enveloping the sun was red. After a few minutes, the colors of the Sun changed from yellow to white. Fifteen minutes Later, the sun shone brightly in the sky. At that time, the glorious clouds had already disappeared, but the Moon still situated in the sky until 7:30am. 
I seldom observed the Sun and the Moon together in the morning sky, so I was curious about their relative positions in the sky. 
The next day, I arose early and enjoyed the impressive view of the sunrise again. There were some cumulus clouds that obscured the morning rays of sunlight. Soon after, a blazing sun broke through the cumulus clouds.  
It was a glorious day that we couldn't observe the whole sunrise. A few minutes before sunrise, I observed a Moon shaped like a sharp and slender scythe. Its Phase was in a form that was an inversion of that observed in July. 
I was surprised by the crescent shape because it was my first time seeing it. After this, I determined to keep on observing sunrises and moonsets in the morning! Every night, I observe the stars and recall the old history of our universe. 
Now, I am starting to share some incredible stories of the Sun. 
It’s uniquely that the Sun stands for a male goddess, which protecting all of the things in the sky. Therefore, it’s a huge ball of hot, luminous gas. All 8 planets and associated moons orbit around it. We call this family the Solar System. 
Without the Sun, a group of plants, creatures on Earth can not survive. Additionally, life depend on the power of our Sun. Please show our appreciation of our star as we depend on it. We get warm from the gentle sunlight, this is the wonderful time! 
Thanks for the sun giving its giant and unlimited energy to lives on our planet！
Thank you very much!
